Collection of personal scripts (bash, etc)

## xubuntu_1804_setup_part1.sh

This script is intended to be run after fresh installation of **Xubuntu 18.04**
on my secondary 11.6-inch laptop **ASUS L203MA**.

I wrote this script while setting up (or tweaking) Xubuntu 18.04, because
I didn't want to set everything manually (which took a lot of time and effort)
in case Xubuntu needs to be reinstalled.

### Usage

In terminal, cd to where this script is saved to, and run:

```bash
./xubuntu_1804_setup_part1.sh
```

or

```bash
bash xubuntu_1804_setup_part1.sh
```

if not executable.

*NOTE:* Most commands should work with other laptops; however, some constants
such as natural scrolling may be specific to ASUS-L203MA.
